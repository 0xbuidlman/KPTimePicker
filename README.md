@interface ViewController () <KPTimePickerDelegate>
```

```objc
#pragma mark - KPTimePickerDelegate

// Returns selected date -- date is nil if back is pressed
-(void)timePicker:(KPTimePicker*)timePicker selectedDate:(NSDate *)date;

@optional
// Get's called every time the date changes - used for customizing the labels
-(NSString*)timePicker:(KPTimePicker*)timePicker titleForDate:(NSDate *)time;
-(NSString*)timePicker:(KPTimePicker*)timePicker clockForDate:(NSDate *)time;

```
